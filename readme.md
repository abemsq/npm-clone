# NPM Clone: Static Website

This is a cloned static landing page of the **NPM website** ([Official
Page](https://www.npmjs.com/)). I have used Google Chrome Developer to pick up
some of their styles, and coded from scratch using Visual Studio Code. 

## This was part of the coding bootcamp's prework. Name cannot be revealed due to privacy policy. ##
